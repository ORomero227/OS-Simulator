## Features

- **Process Management:** The application allows you to simulate the creation, management, and execution of processes.
- **CPU Management:** It provides the ability to configure and manage CPUs within the system.
- **Settings:** Users can adjust various system settings such as the number of CPUs, quantum time, process size, block time, and process generation probability.
- **Visual Display:** The application offers visual representation of system components through Java Swing GUI components.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) for easier development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ORomero227/OS-Simulator.git
2. Open the project in your Java IDE
3. Run the GUI_OperatingSystem.java file to launch the application.

## Usage
- Upon launching the application, you will see the main window that displays various components, including Hard Drive Disk (HDD), Dispatcher, CPUs, Blocked processes, and Finished processes.
- You can interact with the application to simulate the behavior of an operating system, such as clock ticking to progress the simulation.
- You can also access settings and the Process Control Block (PCB) window to configure system settings and view detailed information about processes.
- The application provides a graphical interface for easy interaction with the operating system simulation.
